This is the Atlantean Discord Bot Github. 
Got rid of my command handler, why? idk.
Don't steal code or I will hunt you down.

Atlantean is another discord bot, has a lot of functions including fun, mod, etc. The bot was made, coded, and designed by mangos#0600. The website was coded in html and bot in discord.js v13 lol, node.js. The goal for Atlantean is to get 50 servers by the end of August 2023. Hope you enjoy Atlantean and if you have any feedback/suggestions you can a!suggest, a!feedback and check out feedback on the website.

THIS GITHUB WILL BE UPDATED ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS - SORRY!
